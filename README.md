# Decentralized IP Licensing Platform

A blockchain-based platform for managing intellectual property registration, licensing, and royalty distribution.

## Overview

This platform provides a decentralized solution for intellectual property management, enabling creators and rights holders to securely register their IP, create licensing agreements, manage royalty distributions, and resolve disputes through smart contracts.

## Core Components

### IP Registration Contract

The IP Registration Contract serves as the foundation of the platform, enabling:

- Registration of various IP types (patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.)
- Proof of ownership verification
- IP metadata storage and management
- Transfer of IP rights
- Historical record maintenance of IP ownership

### Licensing Contract

The Licensing Contract facilitates the creation and management of licensing agreements:

- Customizable licensing terms and conditions
- License validation and verification
- Automated license expiration handling
- Usage tracking and reporting
- Multi-party licensing support

### Royalty Distribution Contract

The Royalty Distribution Contract automates the payment process:

- Real-time royalty calculations
- Automated payment distribution to rights holders
- Split payment handling for multiple stakeholders
- Payment history tracking
- Integration with various payment methods

### Dispute Resolution Contract

The Dispute Resolution Contract provides a framework for handling conflicts:

- Dispute submission and documentation
- Multi-stage resolution process
- Arbitrator assignment and management
- Evidence submission and storage
- Resolution enforcement mechanisms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet with sufficient ETH for contract deployment and interactions
- Web3.js or similar Ethereum interaction library
- Node.js v14.0.0 or higher
- Solidity ^0.8.0

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/decentralized-ip-platform.git
cd decentralized-ip-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

## Usage

### Registering IP

```javascript
const ipRegistration = await IPRegistrationContract.deploy();
await ipRegistration.registerIP(
    ipType,
    metadata,
    proofOfOwnership
);
```

### Creating a License

```javascript
const licensing = await LicensingContract.deploy();
await licensing.createLicense(
    ipId,
    licenseeAddress,
    terms,
    duration
);
```

### Setting Up Royalty Distribution

```javascript
const royaltyDistribution = await RoyaltyDistributionContract.deploy();
await royaltyDistribution.setupRoyalty(
    licenseId,
    stakeholders,
    percentages
);
```

## Security

- All smart contracts have undergone thorough security audits
- Implement role-based access control
- Include emergency pause functionality
- Regular security updates and maintenance
